## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The AI Sales Assistant operates through a multi-stage agentic workflow.

### **Stage 1: Information Gathering**

1.  **Document Upload**: The process begins when you upload one or more customer requirement documents through the interactive web interface.
2.  **Requirements Identification**: An "Analyst" agent initiates the process. It uses a predefined checklist of questions to create a structured list of all information required for a proposal.
3.  **Automated Analysis**: A "Document Analyzer" agent then scans the uploaded documents to find answers to these questions, populating the requirements list with any information it discovers.

### **Stage 2: Proposal Generation**

This stage's workflow adapts based on the outcome of the first.

**Scenario A: All Information is Found**

If the "Document Analyzer" agent finds answers to all the required questions within the provided documents, the system proceeds directly to the final step.

**Scenario B: Information Gaps are Detected**

1.  **Interactive Q&A**: If the system detects that some requirements have not been met, it will enter an interactive Q&A mode. You will be prompted in the command line (where the application was launched) to provide the missing answers.
2.  **Data Consolidation**: Your answers are seamlessly integrated with the information previously extracted from the documents.

**Final Step: Proposal Generation**

1.  **Drafting the Proposal**: A "Proposal Generator" agent takes over. It synthesizes all the gathered information‚Äîboth from the documents and your interactive input‚Äîalong with a pre-configured company profile to draft a professional, tailored sales proposal.
2.  **Final Output**: The final, customized proposal is then saved as a text file in the project's root directory.

3.  **Set Up Ollama Models**

    You need to have the language model for generation and the embedding model for analysis. Pull them using the following commands:
    ```bash
    ollama pull llama3
    ollama pull mxbai-embed-large
    ```
    *Ensure the Ollama application is running before you start the assistant.*

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

1.  **Define a Checklist**: Before running, define the standard list of questions you want the assistant to use. This is done in a designated text file within the project.
2.  **Prepare the Upload Location**: Ensure the designated folder for document uploads exists. The application is configured to use a specific path which can be adjusted in the application's source code.
3.  **Launch the Application**: Start the interactive web interface by running the main Streamlit application script from your terminal.
4.  **Upload Documents**: Open your web browser to the local application URL and use the sidebar to upload the customer's PDF documents.
5.  **Run the Crew**: Click the "Run Crew" button in the sidebar to initiate the analysis and proposal generation process.
6.  **Answer Questions (If Prompted)**: If the agents couldn't find all the answers in the PDFs, switch to your terminal. You will be prompted to enter the answers for the remaining questions.
7.  **Retrieve Your Proposal**: A text file containing the final, tailored proposal will be generated in the project's root directory once the process is complete.
